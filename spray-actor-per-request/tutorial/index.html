<h1>Spray Actor Per Request</h1>

<div>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>This project provides an example spray application that uses the Actor per request model.</p>

    <p>Why would you want to spin up an Actor for each HTTP request?</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Easily manage any request scoped Actors in the application core</li>
        <ul>
            <li>The per request actor can clean them up in the event of a timeouts and failures</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Promote <code>Tell, Don't Ask</code></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Using request scoped Actors in the application core can make it easier to use tell (<code>!</code>) over
                ask (<code>?</code>)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>App Overview</h2>

    <p>This example application provides an API to get a list of pets with their owners. There are already two services
        that
        provide a list of pets and a list of animals and the responsibility of this application is to simply aggregate
        these two
        together.</p>

    <p>Our application is made up of three modules:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Application Core</strong> - The <strong>core</strong> module contains the business logic for our
            application. In this example this is
            how we aggregate pets with their owners.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Routing</strong> - The <strong>routing</strong> module contains our spray routing which describes
            our RESTful endpoints. It also contains
            our <strong>PerRequest</strong> actor which bridges the gap between the <strong>routing</strong> and the
            `core` modules and contains the piece of
            code this example project aims to demonstrate.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Clients</strong> - Our code to consume two existing services that provide us with a list of pets and
            a list of owners.
            These services could be databases, RESTful APIs, etc. It doesn't really matter for the purposes of this
            example.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Ideally modules these would be in separate sub-projects to prevent compile time dependencies, however for
        simplicity
        purposes they are just kept in separate packages in this example.</p>

<div>
    <h2>Successful request</h2>

    <p>If we request the pet Lassie:</p>

    <pre><code>GET http://localhost:38080/pets?names=Lassie</code></pre>

    <p>We get a successful response:</p>

    <pre>
      <code>
{
  "pets": [
    {
      "name": "Lassie",
      "owner": {
        "name": "Jeff Morrow"
      }
    }
  ]
}
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>In this scenario, any request scoped actors in the application core are stopped by the <code>PerRequest</code>
        actor.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Request Timeouts</h2>

    <p>Tortoises are slow. If we request a tortoise the <code>PetClient</code> will not reply to our application core
        quick enough. The
        timeout of 2 seconds in our <code>PerRequest</code> actor will happen first.

    <p>

    <pre><code>GET http://localhost:38080/pets?names=Tortoise</code></pre>

    <pre>
      <code>
{
  "message": "Request timeout"
}
      </code>
  </pre>

    <p>In this scenario, any request scoped actors in the application core are stopped by the <code>PerRequest</code>
        actor.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Validation</h2>

    <p>You shouldn't keep a Lion as a pet. Quite frankly they are too dangerous.</p>

    <pre><code>GET http://localhost:38080/pets?names=Lion</pre></code>

    <pre>
      <code>
{
  "message": "Lions are too dangerous!"
}
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>In this scenario, our application core returns a generic <code>Validation</code> message to our
        <code>PerRequest</code> actor to complete. Any
        request scoped actors in the application core are stopped by the <code>PerRequest</code> actor.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Failures</h2>

    <p>What about unexpected failures? There is a "bug" in our application core that throws a
        <code>PetOverflowException</code> if we
        request too many pets:</p>

    <pre><code>GET http://localhost:38080/pets?names=Lassie,Tweety,Tom</code></pre>
    
    <pre>
      <code>
{
  "message": "PetOverflowException: OMG. Pets. Everywhere."
}
      </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Any failures that not handled by the application core can be escalated up to the supervision strategy in our
        <code>PerRequest</code> actor. The <code>PerRequest</code> actor is too generic to recover from any business
        logic failures, so it will
        simply handle all failures by completing the request with an error response. Any request scoped actors in the
        application core are stopped by the <code>PerRequest</code> actor.</p>
